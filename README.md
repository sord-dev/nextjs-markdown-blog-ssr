# nextjs-markdown-blog-ssr

*A Server Side Rendered (SSR) Markdown Blog made in NextJS*

## Lessons Learned

This project has taught me about NextJS' static and server side rendering capabilities and how advantageous this is to have as compared to a normal SPA (single page application) when creating a website.

NextJS takes the advantages of Client Side Rendering with no reloads and others and combines them with the advantages of Server Side Rendering and Static Static Site generation for SEO and speed.
