So, you’ve got your business website built, it’s got all the correct information on it to entice your ideal customer, its load times are optimized so they don’t swipe away, everything is ready to go… but what if they don’t show up?

Well this is a valid fear, as search engine algorithms (the calculations used to rank each website in search engine results) will dictate whether people will see your site when they search for it or not.

As such, it’s in our best interest to always appeal to these algorithms in order to be shown higher in the searches and get more attention to our product or services, and we do this through SEO or Search Engine Optimisation.

## This SEO thing sounds really techy and weird, why should I care?

SEO dictates where you show up on Google, meaning it’s your 24hr salesman. 

Whenever someone searches specifically for what you offer, if you’re optimized well enough and have a legitimately trusted product or service to offer, you’ll be one of the first to come up in.

SEO isn’t like paid google rankings as it’s organic and comes from people naturally searching and finding you, meaning if you stop paying google you won’t lose these leads, giving you a secure stream of traffic.

Beyond just getting our websites traffic, SEO builds trust in your audience, they see more of your content and therefore build a relationship with your brand.
However, whether this is a bad or a good relationship depends on the quality and value of the content, services and products you provide.

If getting more leads wasn’t enough motivation, the fact of the matter is that the competition is using the exact same things to rank higher than you at the moment.

Now this is a good and bad thing, on one hand we have a demonstration as to what’s working in the field already but on the other hand they’re taking your leads. If you can’t beat them, join them and do it better.
