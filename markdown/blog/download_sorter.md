# DL Sorting Script
A download folder sorting script

## Description

My download folder gets constantly cluttered and it dawned on me that I'm able to code something to move them around, and so I did. This will take all your download folder's files and sort them based on their filename extention. (eg. ".exe" or ".jpg").

## Prerequirements

**Make sure to create these three directories before running the script!!**

In your **documents folder** create:

  1. Docs - for .pdf, .doc, .zip, .log, .psd and .rar files
  
  2. Apps - for .exe and .msi files

  3. Unknown - for whatever the script fails to identify

## Cloning this repo

1. To get the sample code from GitHub, use the  `git clone`  command to get a local copy of the remote repository. To clone the sample code, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sord-dev/download_sorter.git
    ```

2. Run the script

    ``` bash
    cd download_sorter
    python script.py
     ```
